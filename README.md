## TODO APP using React & Redux

This project is a simple TODO app built using React and Redux, designed to help you manage tasks without the need for a database. It allows you to perform operations like adding tasks, deleting tasks, updating task details, and marking tasks as completed or not completed, all while maintaining the state using Redux for global state management.

### Technologies Used
